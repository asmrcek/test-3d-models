> Note: Reduced versions use smaller texture (```1024x1024```, while the original uses ```2048x2048```).

## Notes

The mesh has some geometric deformations and isn't closed (the rabbit doesn't have a butt).

## About the model

The model is actually a door stop I have once bought in a mall. Considering the fact it was captured by a phone (using the free 3D Creator mobile app from Sony) and after only few minutes of effort, the result isn't that bad. Since the rabbit sat on the table during the capture, its butt couldn't have been scanned very well, so I decided to remove it completely from the mesh.

## License

You can do whatever you want with the model.
