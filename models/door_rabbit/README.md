## Files

The size of models in tables is mesh-only size, i.e. **without** textures and accompanying files (e.g. material files). If a direct download link is available, the size contains everything (mesh, texture, accompanying files).

> The only exception is the [Nexus](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/nexus/) multi-resolution format, where the size always contains everything, since the format packs everything into a single binary file (or multiple binary files for the "deepzoom" variant).

If not specified otherwise, all meshes contain vertices, texture coordinates and normals.

## Notes

The mesh has some geometric deformations and isn't closed (the rabbit doesn't have a butt). Also, one side of the mesh is darker than the other one.

## About the model

The model is actually a door stop I have once bought in a mall. Considering the fact it was captured by a phone (using the free 3D Creator mobile app from Sony) and after only few minutes of effort, the result isn't that bad. Since the rabbit sat on the table during the capture, its butt couldn't have been scanned very well, so I decided to remove it completely from the mesh.

## License

You can do whatever you want with the model.
